# CPX Back And Forth LEDs

### Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to use ‘for’ loops to control the neopixel LEDs sequence so it goes
back and forth between the first and last pixels.

### Procedure
There are several ways to accomplish the lab requirements, however your grade will depend on
you using two ‘for’ loops. One loop goes forward and the other will go backwards through the
pixels.
An example video can be viewed [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HBzKlwflPD8). 
There is a very short pause between flashes in the example to make the video short, 
but your time may vary. Also of note is that in the clockwise
direction the color is actually blue! An odd artifact of the recording.

### Requirements
- Use two loops
- Use a variable to hold the delay time so different effects can be easily tested
- The loop variable must be used to access the pixels
- Use a constant to hold the value of BLACK so you do not have to use (0, 0, 0) each time
- The color of your light should be different in each direction
  
### Turn-in
-  Put your working code.py file in this repo and push it.
-  Upload a short video demonstrating the flashing lights. (If remote)

### Grading
-  Proper use of comments  
-  Inclusion of required loops, variables and constants  
-  Working code  
-  Video demonstrating working project
